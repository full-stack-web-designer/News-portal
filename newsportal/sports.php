		<p class="sports"><font size="6">I</font>ndia captain Virat Kohli has managed to hold on to his second position behind Australia’s Steve Smith in the ICC Test Rankings for batsmen released on Monday.<br>

		Kohli, with 903 rating points, is 34 points behind Smith (937).<br>

		Besides former Australian captain Smith, compatriot Pat Cummins has also retained his first position in the ICC Test bowlers’ rankings.<br>

		Both Smith and Cummins played key roles in helping Australia retain The Ashes.<br>

		The Ashes culminated with a 135-run victory for England in the fifth and final Test on Sunday. The series ended in a 2-2 draw with Australia retaining the Urn.<br>

		Smith’s scores of 80 and 23 in the two innings in the final Test helped him remain at 937 rating points, an incredible effort since he started the series in fourth position with 857 points before his surge that came courtesy 774 runs in four Tests.

		<p class="sports"><font size="6">W</font>orld junior champion Hima Das’ participation in the World Championships relay events became a matter of intense speculation on Friday after she was left out of the initial entries even though her name can still be added by September 16.<br>

		The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) had on September 9 named seven women, including Hima, for the 4x400m relay and 4x400m mixed relay races. But it is learnt that Hima’s name was missing in the initial entry of Indian women athletes for the two relay races submitted by AFI to the IAAF for the September 27 to October 6 showpiece event in Doha.<br>

		Jisna Mathew, MR Poovamma, Revathi Veeramani, Subha Venkatesan, V K Vismaya and Ramraj Vithya have been entered for the women’s 4x400m relay, while Hima’s name is missing.

			<br>
		It wasn’t tough for the 32-year-old midfielder to take the decision. She is used to being a drifter after she was booted out of her home in Malmura Majgaon village in Assam’s Udalguri district in 2007, the year she cleared her Class 10 and made it to the State team for the nationals.
		<br>
		“That job ensured me a place to stay and some money, barely enough to buy me food. I will not get paid for playing in the nationals, but money cannot buy me the happiness of representing my State in the sport I love,” Ms. Bora said.

		“It is every player’s dream to play the Olympics and Russia, who are now investing in hockey and want to do well in this sport, will surely come well-prepared. We can expect a good challenge from them,” Sreejesh said.

		Eight-time Olympic champion India had mauled Russia 10-0 in the FIH Series Final in Bhubaneswar earlier this year.

			<br>
		Also winning the National titles in their respective categories were Rithvik Thomas, the 26-year old from Bengaluru (Super Stock), Chennai’s Ashwin Datta (Formula LGB 1300) who had sealed the title on Saturday itself, Hyderabad’s Jeet Jhabakh (Ameo Class) and Aiman Sadat (Bangladesh, Ameo Class Junior).
		<br>
		Raghul, 26, thus, earned a sponsored drive from MRF Tyres in one round of the Civic Cup Racing Championship in the United Kingdom. Although he finished fifth in the last race, he picked up sufficient points to clinch the title for the second year in a row while finishing a highly productive weekend when he earned as many as 138 points.
