		<p class="technology"><font size="6">W</font>hen China-based Redmi became a sub-brand, ultimately separating from parent company Xiaomi, on January 10 this year, many expected upgraded smartphone experiences at a bang for their buck. That said, today the brand is launching their first-ever flagship devices: the K20 series.<br>

		Introducing the new Aura Prime design language, the Redmi K20 phones come with an AI triple camera setup, comprising of a 48MP main camera, 8MP (megapixel) telephoto and a 13MP wide-angle. Plus the phones come in three colour variants: glacier blue, flame red and carbon black.<br>

		The K20 family is also powered by a huge 4,000 mAh battery with fast charging, which can last upto two days in regular usage conditions. Both the phones come with USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack and fast-charge support. Redmi K20 series, each device weighing 191gm, comes with the highest quality standards; P2i nano-coating makes the phones splash-proof, while Gorilla® Glass 5 on the front and rear of both phones make them durable and long-lasting.

		<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: An efficient, surprisingly light phone that’s burdened by its price</h2><br><br><br>

		Not on many occasions, I suppose, does a smartphone aid in self-reflection. In this regard, the Aura Glow version of Samsung Note 10+ is somewhat a historical device. A few moments after unboxing it, I was staring at my reflection while checking its back, which bears a striking resemblance to the shiny surface of the late compact disc. You will get the design if you are a fan of flamboyance in fashion. If you aren’t one, like me, you will just ask, to no one in particular, ‘why?’<br>

		<font size="4">Design and display</font><br>
		If you overlook the garish back, a few other annoyances (like the deprivation of the 3.5mm earphone jack) and the hefty price tag (costs ₹79,999), the Note 10+ is an efficient, easy-to-carry smartphone (weighs 196 grams).

		<h2>Are we too dependent on wearable devices?</h2><br><br>

		<p class="technology"><font size="6">T</font>he likes of Black Mirror, Love, Death & Robots and even Archer have taught us to be wary of the dependency we may end up experiencing with the advent of wearable technology, nicknamed wearables. So much of the pull of wearables is geared towards trend up-keep — which some may dub ‘sheepism.’<br>

		So here we are to bust some myths through some long-term experience with our own wearable to which we may have raised a brow.<br>
		‘Listen to your heart’, famously sang Roxette in 1988. That’s advice I’ve taken seriously... which is why when Cardiogram (a smartphone app which functions as a digital health and fitness diary and also helps detect heart conditions) recently partnered with Fitbit, the app was promptly added to my list of downloads. Cardiogram makes use of heart rate and sleep rate data from wearable devices to monitor the wearer’s conditions and understand their symptoms.<br>

		A thin sheet made of sensors that can be placed under a mattress, Dozee works with a free app on Google Play Store or Apple Store. “It has to be laid under a mat or mattress with a thickness of up to 18 inches. Then connect your phone to the Internet for it to start working. There is no need to charge it.”<br>

		The monitor checks heartbeat, respiration, sleep cycle, and stress levels and gives daily reports, which will be stored on a cloud. “It can be accessed by anyone whose phone is connected to Dozee. So, a son or daughter can keep track of their parents’ health, even if they are not living together. There will be an alert for fluctuations in the readings. We have a database of doctors for online consultations.” The device was tested at NIMHANS and Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru. “Dozee is 98.4% accurate,” says Mudit.

		<h2>Google's YouTube to pay $170 million penalty for collecting data on kids</h2><br><br>

		<p class="technology"><font size="6">Y</font>ouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children's channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to deliver million of dollars in targeted advertisements to those viewers.<br>
		Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, and its YouTube video service will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.<br>

		YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children's channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to deliver million of dollars in targeted advertisements to those viewers.<br>

		The settlement with the FTC and the New York attorney general's office, which will receive $34 million, is the largest since a law banning collecting information about children under age 13 came into effect in 1998. The law was revised in 2013 to include “cookies,” used to track a person's internet viewing habits.
