		<p class="Educationp1"><font size="6">T</font>he All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has decided to approve a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) course in Artificial Intelligence and data science to cater to the growing demand for skilled manpower in these technologies, said AICTE chairman Anil Dattatraya Sahasrabudhe in Chennai on Saturday.<br>

		Responding to a question during a session at a conference organised by Education Promotion Society for India (EPSI), he said a committee constituted to assess the need for offering degree programmes in technologies, which are driving the next big transformation, had approved AI and data science alone.<br>

		“Other technologies like Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Cyber Security were considered.<br>

		“However, it was decided that we need not have full-fledged degree programmes on these now. Instead, they can be offered as specialisations,” he said.<br>

		Listing a slew of initiatives being rolled out by AICTE to improve the quality of technical education, he highlighted that a semester-long training programme for faculty members has been made mandatory.

		<h2>NCTE to shut down bad colleges, start new courses for teachers,

		<p class="Educationp1"><font size="6">T</font>o weed out and shut down poor quality teacher education institutions — which have six times more capacity than needed — the National Council for Teacher Education is conducting the first-ever performance appraisals of the 19,000 institutions it oversees.<br>
		“The B.Ed has become a degree for marriage, not teaching. That must change...Our agenda is to close down the bad colleges,” NCTE chairperson Satbir Bedi told The Hindu this week.<br>
		With about 100 seats each, the teacher education institutions potentially produce 19 lakh graduates per year. At the recommended teacher-student ratio of 1:27, the country’s 26 crore students need only 90 lakh teachers overall. If each teacher serves about 30 years, the annual turnover — and need for new teaching candidates — is only about three lakh, said Dr. Bedi. Even leaving aside the spurious, fly-by-night institutions and graduates who obtain B.Ed degrees without attending any class and with no intention of ever becoming a teacher, there are simply too many graduates seeking too few jobs.

		<p class="Educationp1"><font size="6">T</font>raining programmes should be outcome-driven. So, a mechanism to assess the impact of a training programme should be built into it.<br>

		Jacob Jesuroon, head - People Function, Access Healthcare, points out that the assessment should be taken step-by-step, and he illustrates the idea with one of the training systems followed at his company.<br>

		Step one: The immediate response to a training programme. When a training programme has been completed, feedback is sought from the participating employees about the trainer, training content and training environment.<br>

		Step two: The effectiveness of a training programme is gauged from how much it has improved workaday behaviour. “So, after the training is done, we have 30 days of on-the job coaching, which is essentially about observing the extent of behaviour and capability improvement of employees. Wherever necessary, the trainer works with the participants to ensure that lessons taught during the training are reiterated,” says Jesuroon.
